# SAM-analysis
## What is scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM)?
A SAM microscope uses focused sound waves to non-destructively analyse objects. It is commonly used as inspection and failure analysis tool. 
## Operation
A sound wave emitted from a custom transducer is focused on an object and the echo of the reflected wave is then analysed. The waves are reflected on discontinuities in the object, this way all cracks and some material interfaces can be discovered. The transducer is moved over the object and a computer analyses and visualises the data.
