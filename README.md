# SAM-analysis
## What is scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM)?
A SAM microscope uses focused sound waves to non-destructively analyse objects. It is commonly used as inspection and failure analysis tool. 
## Operation
A sound wave emitted from a custom transducer is focused on an object and the echo of the reflected wave is then analysed. The waves are reflected on discontinuities in the object, this way all cracks and some material interfaces can be discovered. The transducer is moved over the object and a computer analyses and visualises the data. 
## TODO
1. Setup a github account.
2. Fork this repository (you will get a copy of this repository on your account). To fork a repository you need to be logged in to your own github account, go to the repository you want to fork and press the `fork` button in the top right corner.
3. Clone the repository to your computer.
4. Write a program to analyse the SAM data. Try to break up the problem into smaller, isolated chunks. Commit to your own local repository. 
5. Submit a PR (pull request) of the running code.
